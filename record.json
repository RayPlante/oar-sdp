The methods are taken from the peer-review scientific literature. The database covers the period from 1988, the year of Tanaka's first paper on the subject, through 2011. Each recipe comes with a literature citation and associated digital object identifier (DOI) when available. The database currently contains entries for over 1250 polymer/matrix combinations.   These methods have not necessarily been tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), nor does NIST claim the database to be a comprehensive list of all methods to be found in the open literature. This database is provided solely as a resource for the mass spectroscopy community.   All polymers are sorted into five main groups:  A - polymers containing carbon and hydrogen only   B - polymers containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (but not nitrogen)  C - polymers containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (oxygen may also be present)  D - polymers containing sulfur, phosphorous, or halides  E - polymers containing one or more of: silicon, germanium, tin, or metals   Within these groups, the polymers are further sorted into classes according to 'Glossary of Class Names of Polymers Based on Chemical Structure and Molecular Architecture (IUPAC Recommendations 2009)' Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 81, No. 6, pp. 1131-1186, 2009. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/PAC-REC-08-01-30. Not every IUPAC class contains a MALDI recipe. This occurs for a number of reasons, but primarily because there are no published methods for many classes.   The database is organized by main chain chemistry. Copolymers can be found under all classes represented by repeat units in their main chain. End group and chair architecture information is available but not as a sortable field. There are entries for dendrimers, nanoparticles, polysaccharides, and homopolymer polypeptides, but the database has significantly less coverage in these areas. The database could be extended into these areas if there is significant community interest.   Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number are provided for all matrices having them. Links to the NIST Chemistry WebBook are available for all matrices having a WebBook entry.

As soon as UTC(NIST) is transmitted to a client, that particular value of UTC(NIST) no longer reflects the current time, which is constantly changing.

The database is designed to be searched for kinetics data based on the specific reactants involved, for reactions resulting in specified products, for all the reactions of a particular species, or for various combinations of these. In addition, the bibliography can be searched by author name or combination of names. The database contains in excess of 38,000 separate reaction records for over 11,700 distinct reactant pairs. These data have been abstracted from over 12,000 papers with literature coverage through early 2000. Rate constant records for a specified reaction are found by searching the Reaction Database. All rate constant records for that reaction are returned, with a link to 'Details' on that record. Each rate constant record contains the following information (as available): Reactants and, if defined, reaction products; Rate parameters: A, n, Ea/R, where k = A* (T/298)**n exp[-(Ea/R)/T], where T is the temperature in Kelvins; Uncertainty in A, n, and Ea/R, if reported; Temperature range of experiment or temperature range of validity of a review or theoretical paper; Pressure range and bulk gas of the experiment; Data type of the record (i.e., experimental, relative rate measurement, theoretical calculation, modeling result, etc.). If the result is a relative rate measurement, then the reaction to which the rate is relative is also given; Experimental procedure, including separate fields for the description of the apparatus, the time resolution of the experiment, and the excitation technique. A majority of contemporary chemical kinetics methods are represented. The Kinetics Database is being expanded to include other resources for the convenience of the users. Presently this includes direct links to the corresponding NIST WebBook page for all substances for which such a link is possible. This is indicated by underling and highlighting the species. The WebBook provides thermodynamic, spectral, and other data on the species.

Thermal conductivity data were compiled from three international comparisons organized from 1997 to 2014.  Measurements were conducted in accordance with standardized test methods (ISO 8302 or ASTM C 177) over a temperature range from 280 K to 320 K.  Nine different thermal insulating materials (either mineral fiber or expanded polystyrene) were examined covering broad ranges of bulk densities (13 kg · m-3 to 200 kg · m-3) and thicknesses (13 mm to 70 mm).  Regression coefficients and their corresponding standard uncertainties for a straight-line model relating thermal conductivity to temperature were computed for material and laboratory.  Characteristics of the fits were examined graphically.  The results indicate that, over a 17-year interval, the majority of test data from LNE and NIST agreed to within ±1.0 %, or less, for mineral fiber materials and to within ±0.5 %, or less, for expanded polystyrene.  The graphical analysis confirmed systematic behavior by material type (that is, mineral fiber versus expanded polystyrene) between laboratories.  The results of the study provide useful information to the national metrology institutes about future developments for thermal insulation reference materials and offer potential insights to the measurement science for the guarded-hot-plate method."],"language":["en"],"bureauCode":["006:55"],"contactPoint":{"hasEmail":"mailto:robert.zarr@nist.gov","fn":"Robert Zarr"},"accessLevel":"public","@id":"ark:/88434/pdr02nrs","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Institute of Standards and Technology"},"doi":"doi:10.18434/T4XK5G","keyword":["bilateral","comparison","expanded polystyrene","expanded uncertainty","fibrous glass","guarded hot plate","inter-laboratory","test method","thermal conductivity","thermal insulation"],"license":null,"modified":"2016-06-14","ediid":"3541C38AF67059C5E0531A57068159D51467","components":[{"filepath":"1467_LNE_NIST_InterlabData2016.zip","format":{"description":"ZIP"},"mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-midas/1467_LNE_NIST_InterlabData2016.zip","title":"Direct access to Data from: Collaborative Guarded-Hot-Plate Tests between the Laboratoire national de mÃ©trologie et d'essais and the National Institute of Standards and Technology","@type":["nrdp:DataFile","dcat:Distribution"],"_extensionSchemas":["https://www.nist.gov/od/dm/nerdm-schema/pub/v0.1#/definitions/DataFile"]},{"accessURL":"https://doi.org/10.18434/T4XK5G","@type":["nrd:Hidden","dcat:Distribution"],"title":"Collaborative Guarded-Hot-Plate Tests between the Laboratoire national de métrologie et d'essais and the National Institute of Standards and Technology"}],"@type":["nrdp:PublicDataResource"]}

This concept requires the development of large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all 'raw' experimental data known to date with detailed descriptions of relevant metadata and uncertainties. The combination of these databases with expert software designed to generate recommended data based on available 'raw' experimental data and their uncertainties leads to the possibility of producing data compilations automatically 'to order' forming a dynamic data infrastructure. The NIST/TRC SOURCE data archival system, currently containing more than 5.0 million experimental data points, is used in conjunction with ThermoData Engine as a comprehensive storage facility for experimental thermophysical and thermochemical property data. Currently, this database contains property data for more than 21,000 pure compounds, 42,500 binary mixtures, 11,500 ternary mixtures, and 6,000 chemical reactions. The scope of the NIST Standard Reference Database 103b is pure compounds, binary mixtures, ternary mixtures, and chemical reactions. The ThermoData Engine (TDE) software incorporates all major stages of the concept implementation, including data retrieval, grouping, normalization, sorting, consistency enforcement, fitting, and prediction for all major thermophysical properties (about 120 properties total) including density, vapor pressure, heat capacity, enthalpies of phase transitions, critical properties, melting and boiling points, etc. The ThermoData Engine fills the gaps in experimental data by the deployment of the automated group-contribution and corresponding-states property prediction, emphasizes enforcement of consistency between related properties, provides for flexibility in selection of default data models depending on the particular data scenario, incorporates a large variety of models for secondary fitting, and allows saving of critically evaluated data in the ThermoML format. TDE supports several equations of state for pure compounds and allows user to fit their parameters to experimental and predicted data. Enthalpies of formation are evaluated on the basis of stored experimental enthalpies of combustion and modified Benson group-contribution method. ThermoML output assures compatibility of the ThermoData Engine with any engineering application equipped with a ThermoML software 'reader'. Periodical Web updates of the local TDE-SOURCE database maintain its up-to-date status, providing new data to users of TDE soon after original publication in the literature. TDE provides access to single-phase thermodynamic and transport property data, VLE, LLE, and SLE data, and does automated evaluation of most of those properties. Certain properties such as densities, critical, and transport properties are described by special fitting equations; phase equilibria data are described by activity coefficient models selected by the user. UNIFAC predictions are generated for mixtures covered by the various versions of the UNIFAC method, including NIST-modified UNIFAC model. Phase diagrams, isotherms, and isobars based on those models can be calculated and drawn for the user'?¿s convenience. Proprietary data can be entered for inclusion in the evaluation, and the user can influence the evaluation process by changing relative data weights or by rejecting particular data sets. TDE is capable to evaluate thermophysical properties and their uncertainties for multi-component material streams. TDE supports evaluation of the thermodynamic properties of chemical reactions such as enthalpies, entropies, Gibbs free energies, and equilibrium constants based on available experimental data as well as group contribution methods. System Requirements: PC with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2003/2008/2012.

Currently datasets and certified values are provided for assessing the accuracy of software for univariate statistics, linear regression, nonlinear regression, and analysis of variance. The collection includes both generated and 'real-world' data of varying levels of difficulty. Generated datasets are designed to challenge specific computations. These include the classic Wampler datasets for testing linear regression algorithms and the Simon \u0026 Lesage datasets for testing analysis of variance algorithms. Real-world data include challenging datasets such as the Longley data for linear regression, and more benign datasets such as the Daniel \u0026 Wood data for nonlinear regression. Certified values are 'best-available' solutions. The certification procedure is described in the web pages for each statistical method.   Datasets are ordered by level of difficulty (lower, average, and higher). Strictly speaking the level of difficulty of a dataset depends on the algorithm. These levels are merely provided as rough guidance for the user. Producing correct results on all datasets of higher difficulty does not imply that your software will pass all datasets of average or even lower difficulty. Similarly, producing correct results for all datasets in this collection does not imply that your software will do the same for your particular dataset. It will, however, provide some degree of assurance, in the sense that your package provides correct results for datasets known to yield incorrect results for some software.

This concept requires the development of large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all 'raw' experimental data known to date with detailed descriptions of relevant metadata and uncertainties. The combination of these databases with expert software designed to generate recommended data based on available 'raw' experimental data and their uncertainties leads to the possibility of producing data compilations automatically 'to order' forming a dynamic data infrastructure. The NIST/TRC SOURCE data archival system, currently containing more than 5.0 million experimental data points, is used in conjunction with ThermoData Engine as a comprehensive storage facility for experimental thermophysical and thermochemical property data. Currently, this database contains property data for more than 21,000 pure compounds.  The scope of the NIST Standard Reference Database 103a is pure compounds only.   The ThermoData Engine (TDE) software incorporates all major stages of the concept implementation, including data retrieval, grouping, normalization, sorting, consistency enforcement, fitting, and prediction for all major thermophysical properties (about 50 properties total) including density, vapor pressure, heat capacity, enthalpies of phase transitions, critical properties, melting and boiling points, etc. The ThermoData Engine fills the gaps in experimental data by deployment of automated group-contribution and corresponding-states property predictions, emphasizes enforcement of consistency between related properties (including those obtained from predictions), provides for flexibility in selection of default data models depending on the particular data scenario, incorporates a large variety of models for secondary fitting, and allows saving of critically evaluated data in ThermoML format. TDE supports several equations of state for pure compounds (original and modified volume-translated Peng-Robinson, Sanchez-Lacombe, PC-SAFT, and Span-Wagner) and allows the user to fit parameters to experimental and predicted data. Enthalpies of formation are evaluated on the basis of stored experimental enthalpies of combustion and modified Benson group-contribution method. ThermoML output assures compatibility of the ThermoData Engine with any engineering application equipped with a ThermoML software 'reader'. Periodical Web updates of the local TDE-SOURCE database maintain its up-to-date status, providing new data to users of TDE soon after original publication in the literature.    System Requirements: PC with Microsoft Windows XP,Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2012. At least 2 GBytes of memory is recommended."],"language":["en"],"bureauCode":["006:55"],"contactPoint":{"hasEmail":"mailto:kenneth.kroenlein@nist.gov","fn":"Kenneth Kroenlein"},"accessLevel":"restricted public","@id":"ark:/88434/pdr02fmh","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Institute of Standards and Technology"},"keyword":["ThermoML","Thermodynamics Research Center","consistency enforcement","data retrieval","experimental data","fitting","grouping","normalization","prediction","sorting","thermochemical","thermodynamics","thermophysical"],"license":"http://www.nist.gov/open/license.cfm","modified":"2013-07-01","ediid":"FDB59097465F5200E043065706813E54103","@type":["nrdp:PublicDataResource"]}

In this method, all chemical compounds are annotated in terms of standard chemical structural fragments. These fragments are then organized into a data tree based on their chemical substructures. Search engines have been developed to use this data tree. These search engines use the Chem-BLAST technique to search on the fragments and look for their chemical structural neighbors. The technique was originally developed in the context of the HIV Structural database to enable a query on inhibitors of HIV protease. (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/hivsdb/hivsdb.html.) Recently the method has been significantly improved to extend to the ligands found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.html.)  The method establishes a tree-like relationship between the rings found in three-letter codes that denote ligands of the structures found in the PDB. Semantic Web relations are established between the structural scaffolds of the ligands and organizes them in an XML database utilizing the Web's Resource Description Framework (RDF). An Adobe Flex-based interface is used to present this information on the Web. Plans are under way to extend this work to non-ring type scaffolds as well. Chem-BLAST has also been extended to structures in PubChem. http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.pl which includes several non-ring standard reused groups such as sulfates.
